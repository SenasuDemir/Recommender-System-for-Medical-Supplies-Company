# ü©∫ Medical Supplies Recommender System üè•

## üìú Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a recommender system for a medical supplies company. The aim is to suggest relevant products to customers based on various criteria, including product descriptions, sales data, and user preferences. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can help the company optimize product recommendations and enhance customer satisfaction.

The project covers the following tasks:

- **Missing Data**: Handling missing data points to ensure a clean and usable dataset.
- **Popular Products**: Identifying the most popular products based on sales volume and dollar amount.
- **Company with Maximum Purchase**: Determining which company has made the most purchases to understand customer behavior.
- **Popularity-Based Recommender System**: Building a simple recommender system that suggests products based on their popularity.
- **Matrix Factorization**: Implementing a more sophisticated recommender system using matrix factorization techniques for improved accuracy.
- **Cosine Similarity for Product Descriptions**: Calculating the similarity between products based on their descriptions to suggest similar products to customers.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tasks Breakdown

### 1. **Missing Data** ‚ùì
Handling missing data is a crucial step in ensuring the dataset's quality and reliability. In this task, we will:
- Identify missing values in the dataset.
- Use imputation techniques or removal of rows/columns depending on the situation.

### 2. **Popular Products** üìä
Identifying the most popular products is an essential aspect of a recommender system. For this task:
- We will analyze the sales data to identify products with the highest sales volume.
- We will also analyze the dollar amount to see which products generate the most revenue.
- This will give insights into customer preferences and which products are most in demand.

### 3. **Company with Maximum Purchase** üè¢
By determining which company has made the most purchases, we can better understand customer behavior. In this task:
- We will analyze purchase data and identify the company that has made the highest number of purchases.
- This information can help us tailor product recommendations for the most frequent customers or companies.

### 4. **Popularity-Based Recommender System** üí°
A simple and effective approach to recommending products is to base the suggestions on popularity. In this task:
- We will build a recommender system that suggests products based on their popularity.
- Popularity will be determined by factors such as sales volume and revenue.
- This system will give users easy access to top-selling products in the medical supplies category.

### 5. **Matrix Factorization** üîÑ
Matrix factorization is a more advanced technique for building recommender systems. In this task:
- We will use matrix factorization methods (such as Singular Value Decomposition or Alternating Least Squares) to model the user-product interaction matrix.
- This method will help in creating personalized recommendations based on user preferences and past interactions.

### 6. **Cosine Similarity for Product Descriptions** üîç
To suggest products that are similar to the ones a customer is viewing or purchasing, we can compute the cosine similarity between product descriptions. In this task:
- We will convert product descriptions into vector representations using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
- We will calculate cosine similarity between product vectors to identify products that are similar in terms of their descriptions.
- This will enable us to recommend products based on text similarity.
